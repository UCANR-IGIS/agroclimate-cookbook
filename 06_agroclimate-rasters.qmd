# Agroclimate Rasters {#sec-rasters}

This chapter will show how to

1) take a raster time series of observed (or modeled) weather data

- Spatial CIMIS
- gridMet
- PRISM

2) Convert it to stars (see caladaptr vignette)

3) Use `stars::sapply()` to compute agroclimate metrics pixel-by-pixel

   - key thing is to put the computation in a function that takes a timeseries vector
 and spits out the agroclimate metric
 
Example: Compute the number of days > 105 degF for one growing season (Apr - Sep) for a small county

4) Visualize multi-year agroclimate metric rasters with animation, or a slideshow kind of thing
