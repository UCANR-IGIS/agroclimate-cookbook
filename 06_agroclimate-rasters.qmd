# Agroclimate Rasters

This chapter will show how to

1) take a raster time series of observed (or modeled) weather data

- Spatial CIMIS
- gridMet
- PRISM

2) Convert it to stars (see caladaptr)

3) Teach them how to use sapply to compute the agroclimate metric pixel-by-pixel

   - key thing is to reduce the computation to a function that takes a timeseries vector
 and spits out the agroclimate metric
 
Example: Compute the number of days > 105 degF for one growing season (Apr - Sep) for a small county

Visualize multi-year agroclimate metric rasters with animation, or a slideshow kind of thing
