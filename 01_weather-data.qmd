# Weather and Climate Data

## Intro

To compute metrics you need daily or hourly weather data. Either observed (i.e., from weather stations) or modeled (i.e., from climate models) data will work.

Most agroclimate metrics require daily data (daily min temp, daily max temp, daily precip)

Some require hourly data (e.g., chill portions). If needed, hourly data can be interpolated from daily data (see <https://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/chillR_book/making-hourly-temperatures.html>)

Things to remember:
 
 - date columns should be converted to R Date class
 
 - date-time columns should be saved as POSIXct objects

 - see also <https://ucanr-igis.github.io/agroclimR/slides/agclimr_slides01.html#(12)>
 
 - think about units
